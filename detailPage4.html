            <h2>Verdant Vigil</h2>
            <p>Surveying its realm from the high perch of a leaf, the green mantis stands as a true warrior of the plant world. This image invites us to look closer at the small, often overlooked defenders of the garden.</p>
            <p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Mantises have a unique ear located on their belly that's especially tuned to the frequency of bat echolocation, their main predator.</p>
            <p><strong>Fascinating Fact:</strong> In a single bound, a mantis can leap over 40 times the length of its own body, making for an impressive display of agility.</p>
