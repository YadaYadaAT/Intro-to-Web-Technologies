                         <p>Mantises are an order (Mantodea) of insects that contains over 2,400 species
                            in about 460 genera in 33 families. The largest family is the Mantidae ("mantids").
                            Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have
                            triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated
                            bodies may or may not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly
                            enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while
                            remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis.

                                        <p>Over 2,400 species of mantis in about 430 genera are recognized.[1]
                                            They are predominantly found in tropical regions, but some live in
                                            temperate areas.[2][3] The systematics of mantises have long been disputed.
                                            Mantises, along with stick insects (Phasmatodea), were once placed in the
                                            order Orthoptera with the cockroaches (now Blattodea) and ice crawlers 
                                            (now Grylloblattodea). Kristensen (1991) combined the Mantodea with the 
                                            cockroaches and termites into the order Dictyoptera, suborder Mantodea.[4][5]
                                            The name mantodea is formed from the Ancient Greek words μάντις (mantis) 
                                            meaning "prophet", and εἶδος (eidos) meaning "form" or "type". It was coined
                                            in 1838 by the German entomologist Hermann Burmeister.[6][7] The order is 
                                            occasionally called the mantes, using a Latinized plural of Greek mantis.
                                            The name mantid properly refers only to members of the family Mantidae,
                                            which was, historically, the only family in the order. The other common
                                            name, praying mantis, applied to any species in the order[8] (though in
                                            Europe mainly to Mantis religiosa), comes from the typical "prayer-like"
                                            posture with folded forelimbs.[9][10] The vernacular plural "mantises"
                                            (used in this article) was confined largely to the US, with "mantids"
                                            predominantly used as the plural in the UK and elsewhere, until the
                                            family Mantidae was further split in 2002.
