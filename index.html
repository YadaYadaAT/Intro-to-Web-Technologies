                     <h1>About Mantises</h1>
                         <p>Praying mantises, captivating creatures belonging to the Mantodea order,
                             are renowned for their unique appearance and predatory prowess.
                              With over 2,400 known species worldwide, mantises exhibit fascinating
                               characteristics that set them apart in the insect world.
                            They boast elongated bodies, triangular heads, and distinctive forelegs
                             adapted for hunting. <span class="kBrealBrCheat"></span>Their compound eyes and swiveling heads make them adept hunters.                        
                            These insects come in various colors and sizes, often blending seamlessly into their 
                            surroundings. Their iconic "prayer" pose is a defensive stance and a testament to their adaptability.
                            Mantises are exclusively carnivorous, preying on a variety of insects. Their diet may include flies,
                             moths, beetles, and even other mantises. Some larger species are known to capture small vertebrates
                              such as frogs or lizards.
