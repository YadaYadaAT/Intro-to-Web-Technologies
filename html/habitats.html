  <h1>Praying Mantises and Their Habitats</h1>
  <div class="green-box">
    <p>Praying mantises are highly adaptable insects that can be found in a variety of habitats around the world. Their ability to thrive in different environments is influenced by their generalist predatory behavior. Here are some common habitats where praying mantises can be found:</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Grasslands and Meadows:</h2>
  <div class="green-box">
    <p>Praying mantises are often found in open grasslands and meadows where they can easily spot and capture prey.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Gardens and Agricultural Areas:</h2>
  <div class="green-box">
    <p>Gardens and agricultural fields provide a diverse range of plant and insect species, making them attractive habitats for praying mantises.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Forests and Woodlands:</h2>
  <div class="green-box">
    <p>In wooded areas, mantises may be found on vegetation and branches where they can camouflage themselves while hunting.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Shrubs and Bushes:</h2>
  <div class="green-box">
    <p>Mantises are frequently found in shrubby and bushy areas where they can hide and ambush their prey.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Urban and Suburban Environments:</h2>
  <div class="green-box">
    <p>Praying mantises are known to adapt to urban and suburban environments, including parks, gardens, and green spaces within cities.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Deserts:</h2>
  <div class="green-box">
    <p>While not as common, some species of praying mantises are adapted to desert environments. They can be found in arid regions where vegetation is still present.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Tropical Rainforests:</h2>
  <div class="green-box">
    <p>Certain species of praying mantises inhabit tropical rainforests, where the dense vegetation and high biodiversity provide abundant prey.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Aquatic Environments:</h2>
  <div class="green-box">
    <p>Some mantis species, such as the aquatic mantis (Ameles spp.), are adapted to wetland habitats, including marshes and areas with seasonal water bodies.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Human-made Structures:</h2>
  <div class="green-box">
    <p>Praying mantises are known to inhabit human-made structures such as buildings, fences, and outdoor structures, especially if these areas attract insects.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Temperature Considerations:</h2>
  <div class="green-box">
    <p>Praying mantises are ectothermic, meaning their body temperature is influenced by the external environment. They are more commonly found in regions with moderate temperatures, but certain species can adapt to a range of climates, including temperate, tropical, and subtropical zones.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="green-box">
    <p>Praying mantises are versatile predators, and their habitats often depend on factors such as food availability, temperature, and vegetation. They are well-camouflaged insects that use their environment to their advantage when ambushing prey. While the specific species of mantis and local environmental conditions can influence their preferred habitats, their adaptability allows them to thrive in a variety of ecosystems.</p>
