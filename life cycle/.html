<h1>Praying Mantis Life Cycle</h1>

<div>
    <h2>Egg Stage:</h2>
    <p>Oviposition: Female praying mantises lay eggs during the fall. They deposit a foamy substance that hardens into a protective case called an ootheca.</p>
    <p>Location: Oothecae are often attached to twigs, branches, or other surfaces, providing protection for the developing eggs.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Nymph Stage:</h2>
    <p>Hatching: The eggs remain dormant during the winter and hatch in the spring, triggered by warmer temperatures.</p>
    <p>Nymphs: Praying mantis nymphs emerge from the ootheca and look like miniature versions of the adults.</p>
    <p>Molting: Nymphs undergo a series of molts, shedding their exoskeletons to accommodate their growing bodies. They resemble adult mantises more closely with each molt.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Adult Stage:</h2>
    <p>Maturation: After undergoing several molts, the nymphs reach adulthood. The time it takes to reach maturity varies depending on the species and environmental conditions.</p>
    <p>Reproductive Stage: Adult praying mantises are now capable of reproducing. They have distinct body structures, including well-developed wings in some species.</p>
    <p>Lifespan: The adult stage is the final stage in the praying mantis life cycle. The lifespan of an adult mantis can range from several weeks to a few months, depending on factors such as species, environmental conditions, and food availability.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Reproduction:</h2>
    <p>Courtship: Praying mantises are known for their unique mating behavior. The male approaches the female cautiously, and the mating ritual involves specific movements and postures.</p>
    <p>Copulation: After successful courtship, copulation occurs, during which the male transfers sperm to the female.</p>
    <p>Cannibalism: In some cases, the female may consume the male after or during copulation. This behavior is not universal among all mantis species but is observed in certain instances.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Egg Laying and Oviposition:</h2>
    <p>Fertilization: After mating, the female may lay multiple oothecae, each containing numerous eggs.</p>
    <p>Oviposition: The female attaches the oothecae to suitable surfaces, providing protection for the eggs until they hatch, starting the cycle anew.</p>
